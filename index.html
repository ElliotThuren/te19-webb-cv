      <p><strong>Escortee</strong>, employed by Marlene, Boston → Salt Lake City</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I was in an accident with Riley and was prepared to die by infection, both of us got infected and decided to wait it out, to spend the last time of our lives talking to each other. Riley slowly turned into an “infected” and I had to put Riley out of her misery. I waited for my turn but i never turned, so i figured that i was immune and told my godmother (Marlene). Marlene planned to escort me to another city where they have labs to make a cure. That is when Marlene was badly hurt with a gunshot wound and could not take me. Then Marlene hands me over to Joel Miller to escort me instead. While Joel escorted me we grew very close as we faced a bunch of enemies and all sorts of “infected”.</li>
